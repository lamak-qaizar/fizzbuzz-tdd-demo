# Fizz buzz

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally and say out loud:

1. Usually the number itself
2. For multiples of three saying **Fizz** instead of the number
3. For the multiples of five saying **Buzz** instead of the number
4. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five saying **FizzBuzz** instead of the number
